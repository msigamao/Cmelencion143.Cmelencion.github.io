				The findings of this study would serve as input. The findings and 
                                conclusion are to come up with clear approved guidelines on the 
                                implementation of the software so that it would be clear to see as
                                to who are the people responsible for the kiosks. The kiosk should 
                                be transferred near the Registrars office to become part of the 
                                basic services of the latter. If budget warrants, acquiring an 
                                additional unit of kiosk is highly recommended to ease 
                                the build-up queues of students patiently waiting to have their turn
                                to use the system. However, the Institute of Information Technology 
                                shall make an 
                                alternative version of the system such as web-based and/or mobile apps for 
                                students to be able to access the system from home or anywhere through 
                                Internet connection. Thus, these require purchasing a web server. The system 
                                needs to undergo refinement of the system to make sure the continued use. 
                                There will be a trained software in-charge who may be responsible for the 
                                registration of students to avoid inaccuracy of account details during the 
                                registration. At the same time the said personnel or student-personnel will serve 
                                as the official person to attend students query upon notice by the Registrars 
                                office.To maintain the records easier and support data repository for future 
                                reference. </p>

                               <p> The finding and conclusion of this research are to develop the 
                                Management Information System, to subdivide the sub- system such as 
                                Manage Enrollee Information, Assign Courses, Assign Subjects, and 
                                Processing Admission. Otherwise, the MCC must develop a web-based 
                                enrollment system that will help enhanced and existing enrollment process. To 
                                develop a system that supports distributed and centralized repository of the 
                                enrollment records. To help the registrar office in securing the data in a more 
                                efficient way. To implement an enhanced enrollment process that will lessen 
                                the enrollment turn around processing time. The system has the ability to save 
                                and edit students information. It generates students study load and get the 
                                total/overall number of students enrolled within the semester. Registrar can add 
                                edit and delete. To develop a prototype web application for the MIS Enrollment Module. 
                                Student can withdraw subjects and can re-enroll. The user can login 
                                to the system with their respective users roles. Administrator have total access 
                                to the system confirming the students who are currently registering add/or 
                                enrolling. Data is the lifeline of every educational institution. Right from the 
                                student turnover rate to the financial records, every piece of data that is/was 
                                ever associated with the college paves way for its development. The bigger the 
                                institution, the greater the volume of institutional data, which makes it 
                                challenging to manage on paper or even with excel files. A Management 
                                Information System or MIS is a central data repository capable of not only 
                                gathering, organizing, and storing student data but also processing and 
                                analyzing it and generating various reports from it.</em>
